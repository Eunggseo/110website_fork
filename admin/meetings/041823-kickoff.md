### Re-introductions in-person

All group members took the time to reintroduce themselves and their background (technical and person) with the group in an in-person setting.

### Discuss Meeting Structure
___
For temporary/initial purposes, the group decided to go with a traditional group structure as outlined in the Kickoff Meeting canvas assignment. For the future, the group will start with a quick recap of the last meeting and any tasks that were assigned after the prior meeting. Once everyone is up to speed, we will proceed with discussing the tasks pertinent to the upcoming deadlines, concluding with an assignment of tasks and objects to complete after the meeting. 
____
### GitHub Repo Setup
____
Emily took the lead on setting up the initial GitHub Repo, with Aryan and Adam being setup as admin alongside Team 13 TA Akshay. Relevant folders were setup based on guidelines set forth on the Canvas Assignment. 
____
### Banner and Team Branding
____
Adhithi colored in the team numbers as well as the 'yes' and 'no' symbols on the team banner. The team decided on theming our groups based on '13' being an unluckly number. It was decided that the team logo would be a black cat with 13 represented in the drawing as well. Molly took the lead to generate the team logo using Figma. For the team name, ideas that were suggested included 'Friday the 13th' and 'Black Cat Crew'. Tentatively the group name was set to 'Black Cat Crew'. With regards, to the Team Page, Emily took the lead on creation with all members being required to submit their profile information to Emily for inclusion on the Team Page. 
____
### Team Video Discussion
___
Regarding the team video, Adhithi suggested it be styled in the theme of 'The Office' intro. Each team member would create a video clip where they are pictured 'in the zone' with a certain task and then wave to the camer. a All team members will provide their 'feature' for the video to Molly who will compile the video together. Further guidelines will be discussed in the Slack as needed. 
____
### 8-Ball Prototype Discussion
____
For a non-synchornous brain-storming phase to develop ideas for the 8-Ball prototype, the #design channel in the slack will serve as a space for all team members to submit and share ideas related to the rough design for the 8-Ball prototype. Kenzo took a lead role for this and started off by submitting list of thoughts he had during the previous class lecture with regards to app design. Will have a followup meeting Friday at 4pm on Zoom to finalize all design ideas and then construct a structured plan to develop the app and its necessary deliverables by Monday from there.
