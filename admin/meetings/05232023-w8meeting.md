### Catch up on Approving Pull requests
- We kind of fell behind on approving pull requests since implementing the "1 other person has to confirm the pull request" rule we created but just approved Adhithi's and Molly's so we're
somewhat caught up now. 
- Need to focus on approving future pull requests in a more timely manner so we can keep up with CI/CD pipeline.
