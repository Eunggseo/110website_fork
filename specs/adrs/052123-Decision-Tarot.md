# {Fortune telling - Tarot cards}

## Context and Problem Statement

Fortune telling can be delivered in many ways, 8-ball, astrology and many more. We chose Tarot cards to be our main goal of fortune telling because it is popular and can be implemented in a very cool way for our website. How can we make our fortune telling related to our group theme, the black cat crew? How can we make our fortune telling interesting to the users?
