# Suggestion option for the fortune telling

## Context and Problem Statement

Sometimes good application and websites has a suggestion box that allows the user to input their thoughts so that the developers can look at their feedback and implement to improve the user's experience.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Good websites are implemented on the user's needs and wants, so we included a suggestion option for the user to enter their feedbacks and thoughts
* Currently we are only implementing 1 or 2 fortune telling methods and we would like to hear the user's feedback on what they want to see.

## Considered Options

* Suggestion box for users


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Suggestion box for users because it is the only option and providing users with a way to give feedback is a way to have a user centered design.
